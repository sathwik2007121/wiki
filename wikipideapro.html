                      <p>Konidela Pawan Kalyan[5] (born Konidela Sri Kalyan Kumar;[8] 2 September 1971)[2] is an Indian politician, actor, serving as the 11th Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh since June 2024. He is also the Minister of Panchayat Raj, Rural Development and Rural Water Supply; Environment, Forest, Science and Technology in the Government of Andhra Pradesh as MLA representing the Pithapuram constituency.[3] He is the founder and president of the Janasena Party.</p>
                      <p>As an actor, Kalyan is known for his distinctive style and mannerisms in Telugu cinema. He enjoys a huge fanbase across the Telugu states, often described as "unfathomable," "fiercely loyal," and akin to a "cult following."[12] He is among the highest-paid actors in Indian cinema and has been featured in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 list multiple times since 2012.[13][18] He is the recipient of a Filmfare Award and a SIIMA Award among other accolades.</p>
                      <p>Kalyan made his acting debut in the 1996 film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi. Then, he had a streak of six consecutive hits, among which Tholi Prema (1998), Thammudu (1999), Badri (2000), and Kushi (2001) became back-to-back blockbusters. These films established Kalyan as a youth icon with a massive following distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's fanbase.[9][11] In 2001, he became the first ever South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi.[22] Kalyan later faced a slump, yet his popularity kept soaring despite the flops.[24] He made a comeback with Jalsa (2008), the highest-grossing Telugu film of that year, and continued with hits like Gabbar Singh (2012), Attarintiki Daredi (2013), Gopala Gopala (2015), Vakeel Saab (2021), and Bheemla Nayak (2022). He received the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for Gabbar Singh. Both Kushi and Attarintiki Daredi held the record for the highest-grossing Telugu film of its era.[25]</p>
                      <p>Kalyan holds a black belt in Karate.[26] In 1997, he was awarded the title "Pawan" by the Isshin-ryū Karate Association after a public martial arts demonstration.[27] He practices various martial arts, which he regularly showcases in his films both as a performer and an action choreographer. He is known as "Power Star" among his fans and the media.[28] Kalyan is also recognized for his extensive philanthropic work, supporting various social causes.[29] He has offered financial assistance to both individuals and organizations in need. In 2007, he established the charity Common Man Protection Force.[32]</p>
                      <p>In March 2014, Pawan Kalyan founded the Janasena Party (JSP). Although he chose not to contest the 2014 elections, his support and campaigns were pivotal in securing victory for the TDP-BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh.[33] He later brought national attention to the chronic kidney disease crisis in Uddanam,[34] and led protests against forced land acquisition,[31] and illegal mining in reserved forests.[35] In 2019, JSP contested its first elections, winning one MLA seat with around 6% of the vote. Following this, Kalyan and JSP focused on issues like farmer welfare, illegal sand mining, women's safety, and land encroachment. In 2023, he launched a state-wide tour in his customized vehicle 'Varahi' to connect with voters. In the 2024 elections, Kalyan played a key role in forming an alliance between JSP, TDP, and BJP, which led to a landslide victory.[36] Janasena won each of the 21 MLA seats and 2 MP seats it contested. Kalyan was elected from the Pithapuram constituency by a margin of over 70,000 votes, subsequently becoming the deputy chief minister.[37]</p>

                   <p>Pawan Kalyan was born as Konidela Kalyan Kumar[39] on 2 September 1971[2] in a Telugu family to Konidela Venkata Rao and Anjana Devi in Bapatla, Andhra Pradesh.[43][44] Venkata Rao worked as an excise police constable and was transferred on a regular basis.

Kalyan was educated at the St. Joseph's High School in Nellore and later in Madras (now Chennai).[45] In 1997, he was awarded the title "Pawan" by the Isshin-ryū Karate Association after a public martial arts demonstration.[27] He also holds a black belt in Karate.[26]

                    <b>1996–1997: Early work</b>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">Kalyan made his acting debut in 1996 with Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi directed by E. V. V. Satyanarayana.[46] It was produced by Allu Aravind under Geeta Arts Banner, and co-starred Supriya Yarlagadda, granddaughter of Akkineni Nageswara Rao. The film employed a unique marketing campaign prior to its release. Initially, posters featuring Kalyan were released with the question, "Who is this guy?". Later, before the film's release, posters declaring "This is our Kalyan" further heightened audience interest.[47] Released in October 1996, the film was a moderate success at the box-office.[46] Kalyan’s performance and martial arts skills received significant attention</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">His second film Gokulamlo Seeta (1997), a drama film released the following year.[49] It was directed by Muthyala Subbaiah and starred Kalyan alongside Raasi and Harish. In the film, Kalyan plays a spoiled rich youth who transforms his reckless ways and fights against societal and familial opposition to win his love. Gokulamlo Seeta was the first film where Kalyan was credited as 'Pawan Kalyan' after he was awarded the title "Pawan" in March 1997.[50] It was a commercial success.</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">Kalyan's third film was Suswagatham (1998) directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao and produced by R. B. Choudary under the Super Good Films banner. It starred Kalyan and Devayani (in her Telugu debut), with music composed by S. A. Rajkumar.[46] Kalyan was first credited with the title Power Star in this film.[49][52] In the film, Kalyan played a young man who loses everything due to his blind love for a girl. His performance in the film was critically acclaimed. Suswagatham sowed the seeds for Kalyan's rise to stardom. The film became a super hit at the box office.</p></div>

                    <b>1998–2001: Success streak and stardom</b>
                    <p>Kalyan's next film was Tholi Prema (1998), directed by VoA. Karunakaran and co-starring Keerthi Reddy with music by Deva. Karunakaran saw Pawan Kalyan's photo on a Telugu film magazine cover in Chennai and thought he was perfect for the lead in his romantic film. After sharing the script with Kalyan, Kalyan introduced him to producer G. V. G. Raju, who had worked with him on Gokulamlo Seeta.[53] The film was a major hit, launching Kalyan into stardom and becoming a classic romantic film in Telugu cinema.[54] It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu, six state Nandi Awards, and was featured at the 30th International Film Festival of India. The film was remade in Kannada as Preethsu Thappenilla (2000) and in Hindi as Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai (2001)</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">In November 1998, there were reports of Kalyan collaborating with Malayalam director Fazil for a project to be produced by G. V. G. Raju, who had earlier produced Tholi Prema.[56] However, his next film turned out to be Thammudu, where he played the role of a kickboxer. Released in July 1999, Thammudu was written and directed by P. A. Arun Prasad.[57] The film collected a distributor share of ₹9.25–9.46 crore, emerging as a blockbuster and generating a profit of over ₹4 crores for buyers.[58] It became the second-highest-grossing film in the Nizam region after Choodalani Vundi (1998).[58] Kalyan's performance as a youth competing in a kickboxing contest was widely acclaimed.[57] The film's success led to it being remade in Tamil as Badri (2001), in Kannada as Yuvaraja (2001) and in Bengali as Champion (2003).</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">Next, Kalyan acted in Puri Jagannadh's first directorial venture, Badri (2000). It starred debutants Ameesha Patel and Renu Desai (whom he would later marry). It was produced by T. Trivikrama Rao and the music was composed by Ramana Gogula.[60] The film became a blockbuster at the box office. Badri played a crucial role in expanding Pawan Kalyan's appeal from class audiences, who admired his earlier hits to a broader mass audience.[61] The intense scenes between Pawan Kalyan and Prakash Raj remain a significant highlight in Pawan's career.[61] The film's dialogues and songs were huge hits with the youth. The line "Nuvvu Nanda aithe nenu Badri Badrinath" and songs like "Ye Chikitha" and "Bangala Kathamlo" continued to be popular even after two decades.[62] Badri was later remade in Hindi as Shart: The Challenge (2004)</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">Kalyan's next film was Kushi (2001) co-starring Bhumika. It was directed by S. J. Surya and produced by A. M. Rathnam.[64] Mani Sharma provided the score and soundtrack. Kalyan also choreographed all the action sequences in the film. Initially begun in 1999 as a bilingual along with its Tamil version, also titled Kushi (2000), the Telugu version was delayed due to Kalyan's prior commitment to Badri.[68] It was a blockbuster at the box office and went on to become the highest-grossing Telugu film ever at the time.[71] The film was critically acclaimed for its screenplay, music, cinematography and especially the performance of Pawan Kalyan.[72] Kushi was the culmination of a streak of six consecutive hits for Pawan Kalyan and his style, mannerisms and dialogues from the film were much imitated by the youth</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">The four consecutive blockbuster hits—Tholi Prema, Thammudu, Badri, and Kushi—had a cult status among youth at the turn of the millennium.[73] Pawan Kalyan became a youth icon, setting trends in action sequences, style, and fashion. These films gave him a massive fanbase, distinct from his elder brother Chiranjeevi's.[9][11] In 2001, Kalyan became the first South Indian brand ambassador for Pepsi, while Chiranjeevi promoted Coca-Cola.</p>

                    <b>2002–2007: Directorial debut and career fluctuations</b>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">Kalyan's next film was Johnny (2003), which he wrote, directed, and starred in alongside Renu Desai.[76] Produced by Allu Aravind with music by Ramana Gogula, the martial arts film featured Kalyan as a coach who fights to fund his wife's cancer treatment.[77] Johnny had the highest theatrical distribution rights of ₹21 crore for a Telugu film at the time[78] and was released with over 250 prints worldwide.[79][80] Kalyan's clean-shaven look was a departure from his usual style which disappointed many fans.[81] Despite being Pawan Kalyan's first flop after six consecutive hits, the film was praised for its stylish and grounded action choreography.[82] Kalyan's styling from the film became a trend, with Johnny T-shirts, bandanas, armbands, and caps becoming very popular.[83] It was also screened at the International Film Festival of India.</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">In 2004, his film Gudumba Shankar was released. The film was directed by Veera Shankar and produced by Kalyan's older brother Nagendra Babu under Anjana Productions banner.[84] Kalyan played the title role, wrote the screenplay and choreographed three songs. The action scenes were also conceived and choreographed by him. The film, starring Kalyan and Meera Jasmine, received mixed reviews and was an average performer at the box office. Kalyan's choreography of the realistic action scenes was praised. His unique style, including wearing double pants, grabbed attention at the time</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">His next film Balu (2005) was A. Karunakaran's second directorial starring Kalyan, after Tholi Prema. This film was produced by C. Aswini Dutt under Vyjayanthi Movies banner.[85] It co-starred Shriya, Neha Oberoi and Gulshan Grover. Balu was extensively filmed in Delhi and Agra, with a special set constructed near the Taj Mahal and another in Ramoji Film City, Hyderabad, at a cost of ₹90 lakh. Pawan Kalyan wore a unique pant in the film's flashback scenes, which he bought from Italy for about ₹2 lakh.[86] These pants later became a trend among the youth.[83][81] Balu was the first Telugu film to have a release in South Africa and became an average grosser at the box office.</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">In May 2006, Bangaram, directed by Tamil filmmaker Dharani was released. It starred Kalyan in the title role and Meera Chopra, Sanusha, Ashutosh Rana, and Mukesh Rishi in supporting roles. Produced by A. M. Rathnam, who had earlier produced Kushi (2001), the story follows Bangaram, a reporter who dreams of working for the BBC. Notably, it was the first time in Kalyan's career that he did not have a female lead opposite him. The film received mixed to negative reviews, and Kalyan reportedly gave refunds to the film's distributors due to its underperformance</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">In March 2006, Pawan Kalyan’s second directorial venture, Satyagrahi (tagline: Satyame Naa Ayudham; transl. Truth is my weapon), featuring him in the role of a role of student union leader, was launched with a high-profile event at Annapurna Studios.[91] At the event, Kalyan expressed frustration with societal problems and aimed to use Satyagrahi to highlight these issues in a commercially appealing format. Producer A. M. Rathnam announced that the film would be made in Telugu and Hindi, with a Bengali dub.[91] Despite initial enthusiasm and notable collaborators like P. C. Sreeram and A. R. Rahman, the project was shelved. In October 2021, Kalyan revealed that the film, inspired by Jayaprakash Narayan's Emergency movement, was set aside to focus on real-life activism, finding it more fulfilling to address social issues directly rather than through cinema.</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">Later that year, he appeared in Annavaram, directed by Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao, with Asin, and Sandhya were cast alongside him.[93] The film was produced under the Super Good Films banner and marked Kalyan's first role set in a rural background. Pawan Kalyan plays the title role of Annavaram, a blacksmith who, driven by his love for his sister, becomes a vigilante in Hyderabad to dismantle the city's criminal underworld.[93] Released in December 2006, the film was an above-average grosser</p>
                     <div class="2008–2011: Continued career" id="2008–2011: Continued caree"></div>
                    <b>2008–2011: Continued career</b>
                    
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">Kalyan's next film was Jalsa (2008), written and directed by Trivikram Srinivas. Jalsa marks the first collaboration between Pawan Kalyan and Trivikram, a partnership that later extended to multiple projects in the future. Mahesh Babu provided the voiceover for the film. In the film, Pawan Kalyan plays Sanjay Sahu, an aerobics instructor with a troubled past as a Naxalite. Kalyan's performance, especially his comic timing and signature dialogues, played a significant role in the film's success.[95] Jalsa set multiple box office records on its opening day, including the highest first-day collection for a Telugu film and the highest for any South Indian film in a single state.[95] It became the highest-grossing Telugu film of 2008[95] and was praised for its lead performances, music, humour, and witty dialogues.[95] This marked Kalyan's first success after five consecutive underperforming films</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">Pawan Kalyan's next film, Puli (2010), an action thriller, was written and directed by S. J. Surya and produced by Singanamala Ramesh Babu with a budget of ₹40 crore.[96] Initially titled Komaram Puli, the film was renamed Puli on its second day of release due to objections from Komaram Sony Rao, the grandson of tribal legend Komaram Bheem, whose name had inspired the original title. The Nizam distribution rights were sold to Geetha Arts for ₹12 crore, a record-breaking sum at the time.[97] Upon release, Puli was critically panned and ultimately became a box office disaster.[</p>
                    
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">In August 2010, an official announcement was made that Kalyan was going to play a role in a movie about Jesus Christ to be directed by Singeetam Srinivasa Rao.[99] With a production cost of $30 million, it was touted as the most expensive film to be ever made in Indian cinema.[100] The film was set to be shot in Israel and the Palestinian Territories with an all-Indian cast, primarily featuring children. It was reported that the producers spent time touring sites in Jerusalem and around the Sea of Galilee and have approached the Palestinian Authority about filming in Jericho and Bethlehem.[99] Shooting for the film was said to begin in Jerusalem in October 2010 and the film was to be released in 2011. The film was said to include seven devotional songs. It was to be a 195-minute film, with versions in four languages, including English</p>
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">In 2011, Pawan Kalyan starred in Teen Maar, directed by Jayanth C. Paranjee with a screenplay by Trivikram Srinivas.[101] It is a remake of the Hindi film Love Aaj Kal (2009). Kalyan plays dual roles: Michael Velayudham, a carefree chef in Italy navigating modern relationships, and Arjun Palwai, whose traditional 1980s love story profoundly influences Michael's journey toward understanding the true value of love and commitment. The film was an average grosser at the box office.</p>
                    
                    <p style=" padding-left: 30px;">Kalyan's next film was Vishnuvardhan's gangster drama Panjaa (2011).[102] Apart from Kalyan, it starred Sarah-Jane Dias, Anjali Lavania, and Jackie Shroff. Kalyan showcased a new look for Panjaa, combining a well-trimmed beard with his moustache.[81] In the film, Kalyan plays Jai, a loyal hitman for a powerful gangster, who is forced to go on the run after a mission goes wrong. Released in December 2011, Panjaa received mixed reviews from critics.[90] It had a moderate reception from overseas audiences but struggled to make an impact at the domestic box office.[98] Over time, it has been regarded as an underrated film in Telugu cinema</p>
                     <div class="2012–2013: Comeback with blockbuster hits" id="2012–2013: Comeback with blockbuster hits"></div>
                    <b>2012–2013: Comeback with blockbuster hits</b>
